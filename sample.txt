Hypertension is a chronic medical condition characterized by elevated blood pressure. It can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Management includes lifestyle modification and pharmacologic therapy (e.g., thiazides, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers). Diagnosis relies on repeated measurements and ambulatory monitoring.

Complications include left ventricular hypertrophy and retinopathy.
